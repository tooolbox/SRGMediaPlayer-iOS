/**
 *  Button which is automatically shown when Airplay is active, hidden otherwise. If your controls are stacked using a
 *  `UIStackView`, the layout will automatically adjust when the button appears or disappears.
 *
 *  A media player controller can be optionally attached. If Airplay playback mirroring is used (the `AVPlayer`
 *  `usesExternalPlaybackWhileExternalScreenIsActive` property has been set to `NO`), no button will be displayed
 *  (Airplay can still be enabled from the control center). If no media player controller is attached, the button will 
 *  be displayed for any kind of Airplay usage.
 *
 *  The button is automatically shown or hidden by having its `hidden` property automatically adjusted. Attempting
 *  to manually alter this property leads to undefined behavior. You can force the button to always be hidden by
 *  setting its `alwaysHidden` property to `YES` if needed.
